# JIRAc: a comment helper

## Goal

Automate JIRA comment creation.
It will put the comment contents in your clipboard.

## Setup

 1. git clone ... ;)
 1. cd /path/to/clone
 1. ./jirac

If you want to use `jirac` from anywhere, make sure to 
export `/path/to/clone` into your PATH (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`...).

Once launched, just answer a few questions.

## Troubleshooting

Ping @fbiville/@Ismael on Flowdock.
Create a Gitlab issue if needed.
